# What is it

This is a silly python script that takes an argument, pulls lyrics from chartlyrics.com rest API, combs through SOAP to find the first result,
does a horrible thing and parses the html with regex, and returns them to stdout

# Why was it created
I was looking for something to populate a screensaver that takes the output of a command ;)

[..TOC..](#table-of-contents)
# Installation
Developed on Python 2.7.8

[..TOC..](#table-of-contents)
# How do I use it
run lyrics-puller.py to see usage

[..TOC..](#table-of-contents)
# Todos
Probably nothing :)
